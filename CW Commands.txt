TACTICAL COMMANDS
=================

These commands are issued by squad leader PRESENT AT THE SITE. Movement commands should allways be issued together with engagement commands to ensure the right response from soldiers. The commands can be issued to the whole group (Push and open fire, Hold & Peek-a-boo) or to single tank (Retreat and Take cover - i.e. to keep tank on low health alive for next CW battle)


1. Tactical movement commands
-----------------------------

## In my opinion, commands should be one short word (yes, just like for dogs :)). "Strict + something" just doesn't cut it here. These commands must be clear when issued EVEN UNDER FIRE. Can you imagine Hawker yelling "Retreat strict! Retreat Strict!" :D I cannot. Its not practical. That's why I have changed back to older version despite our previous agreement. Do you agree with my explanation?

(describing the mode of movement)

1.1. Push

While pushing IT IS ALLOWED TO STOP for the right reasons. You can stop to aim-and-shoot. You can stop to avoid being hitted. It is allowed to stop if you are at low health and/or you think moving forward is not a very good idea (inform commander!). It is allways important NOT TO BLOCK your teammate's movement and/or line of fire while pushing unless told otherwise (narrow/cluster movement).

1.2. Rush

Same as Push, but DO NOT STOP for any reason other to being detracked. The idea is ussualy exploit/gain some tactical (more tanks) or strategic advantage over the enemy.

1.3. Hold (position)

You are to hold your (general) position at any circumstances unless told otherwise. The engagement command should describe the details.  

1.4. Back

While going back IT IS ALLOWED TO STOP for the right reasons. The general idea is TO SLOW DOWN THE ENEMY. These reasons include aim-and-shoot, reloading while in cover, if you estimate you are in good enough position to fight the enemy... 

1.5. Retreat

Same as Retreat, but IT IS BEST NOT TO STOP. The general idea is to KEEP YOUR TANK ALIVE. Your tank is needed elswhere where it contribute better to overall victory and it is your duty to keep it alive as long as possible.



2. Tactical Engagement commands
-------------------------------

(describing the mode of enemy engagement)

2.1. Peek-a-boo (Default engagement mode)

If the squad leader or commander does not issue the engagement command, this is the default mode.

2.2. Open Fire

Open fire but DON'T BREAK FORMATION. Engage allways the lowest health tank or marked tank!

2.3. Attack-at-will

Attack as you wish. It is ALLOWED TO BREAK FORMATION and flank the enemy.

2.4. Take Cover (From fire)

Tanks given this order should find cover from enemy fire at all cost.

2.5. Hold Fire / Hide (From view) 

DO NOT FIRE at any cost! (i.e. issued during entrapment, or spotting/patrolling). Tanks given this order should find cover from enemy view at all cost and stay hidden until further notice.

## I've joined these 2 commands. Hold fire has no meaning while spotted by the enemy.



STRATEGIC COMMANDS
==================

## I've changed the concept into one in which strategic modes - Passive and Aggressive (AND IF UNSPOKEN, THEN DEFAUTS TO NORMAL) - change the behaviour of our tanks and way the strategic tasks are executed. Also, I've shorten the list to 5 commands, which is better. Everything seems intuitive to me now, what do you think?.
## As you can see, I've eliminated "strict" completely. No need for it. Also, I think, from my experience in the army and navy (and also dog trianing :D) that the commands should consist of only one word, if possible (we already have strategic mode secondary command, so...)
## Also, one special command is Move - El Halluf move to their hill i.e. It has no modes (modifiers). We use it alot so...

These commands are issued by team commander. The idea for this commands is to convey general strategic idea from the commander to the squad leaders AND/OR to the soldiers, but without unnecessary details and micromanagement involved. Strategic commands are to ensure that the general expected behaviour of every individual soldier is clear to all, even without squad leader to enforce them. Strategic task commands are not necessary issued in pairs with strategic mode commands. The commands are to be issued to the group of tanks, but can be applied to individuals also.


3. Strategic task commands
--------------------------

3.1. Move to X

## Ex Run

Unconditional strategic repositioning of the tanks. You DO NOT STOP for any reason other to being detracked. The idea using Move is to gain strategic POSITIONAL advantage over the enemy. No short term tactical gain (killing or damaging enemy tanks) is an excuse to disobay this command.

This command is special and it has no modes. 

3.2. Advance to(wards) X

## Ex move, joined together with advance from strategic modes

Passive - While advancing YOU MUST STOP if faced with the opposition.

Normal - While advancing IT IS ALLOWED TO STOP for the right reasons. Similar to tactical push command - you advance towards the designated position and do not stop unless you have good reasons to do it.

Aggressive - While advancing IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO STOP until the enemy is eliminated or the designated position is reached. Similar to tactical Rush command.

3.3. Capture (and hold position) X / Defend X

## incorporated Defend from strategic modes here

The goal for this command is to capture (or drive to) a specific position on a map and defend it until told otherwise. The command is executed sucessfully when all tanks are on the designated position and with no opposition present.

## The main difference to the Advance command is that the Advance command is DIRECTIONAL, and Capture/Defend command is POSITIONAL - That's why we need both. 

Passive - KEEP TANKS ALIVE, RETREAT IF WEAKER

Normal - ADAPT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES, DO NOT TAKE UNNECESSARY RISKS

Aggressive - KILL ALL ENEMY, DO NOT RETREAT

3.4. Engage X

Passive - The goal for this command is to DISTRACT OR LURE enemy group of tanks, but safely in a way that the enemy cannot deal much damage to friendly tanks. The group should disengage and retreat automatically if the enemy counterattacks in force. 

Normal - The goal for this command is to ATTACK designated enemy group of tanks and try to eliminate them, but NOT AT ANY COST (use your brain soldier!). The group should remain engaged with enemy until told otherwise.

Aggressive - The goal for this command is to KILL designated enemy group of tanks AT ANY COST (Short of kamikaze attack). The group should remain engaged with enemy until told otherwise.

3.5. Fall back (to X)

Passive - a form of retreat with main idea of keeping alive as many tanks as possible for the continuation of the battle. The tank group should retreat to the designated (or the SAFEST) position in the QUICKEST AND THE MOST SAFE WAY possible. If needed This command is similar to tactical retreat command.

Normal - fighting retreat used either for slowing down the enemy if overpowered or for luring the enemy into a trap or into a bad strategic position. If the enemy stops advance, the tank group should still RETREAT TO THE DESIGNATED POSITION and await further orders.

Aggressive - fighting retreat used for slowing down the enemy if overpowered. The idea is to go backward gradually while still engaged with the enemy. If the enemy stops advance, the tank group should HOLD THE NEW POSITION and await further orders.




4. Strategic mode commands
--------------------------

Strategic mode commands are regularly issued together with strategic tasks commands and they change the nature of task execution.

These commands are the most general directions possible from the commander to his tanks. The idea is to allow the commander to delegate reposibility to a platoon which will allow him to concentrate his attention elswhere on the battlefield, while ensuring that the group of tanks which recieved the command will not screw up bigtime, even if no squad leader is present. In short, these commands represent general guidelines for tank movement while faced with the enemy. The commands are dynamic and soldiers should adapt depending on the situation. 

4.1. Passive

The main goal is to KEEP OUR TANKS SAFE. Platoon leader should PUSH FORWARD ONLY UPON PERMIT from the commander.

Tells the platoon leader to be defensive and not risk anything. The platoon should hold the general position they were assigned, but fall back if the platoon leader deems this necessary (but should inform the commander when that happens). They should not push forward, even if the squad leader thinks it's possible. 

4.2. Aggressive

The main goal is to ELIMINATE THE ENEMY. Platoon leader should RETREAT ONLY UPON PERMIT from the commander.

Tells the platoon leader to be aggressive and try to eliminate the enemy even at high cost (everything short of kamikaze attack is fine). 

4.3. Normal

The main goal is to ADAPT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES. PUSH/KILL IF POSSIBLE, RETREAT IF NECESSARY. It is the default mode.

This mode does not need to be ordered by the commander. If strategic task is issued without specific mode, it falls upon platoon leader and/or tanks in the field to adapt to the situation.



Example: "Defend aggresive at F4" (think the pass behind snipe position on Mountain Pass) , "Advance (normal - not spoken) towards enemy base" (Think uphill on El Halluf), "Passive capture the city deep" on Lakeville



BATTLE COMMANDS
===============

Issued by the squad leader in the battle, basically the name of a tactic that should be employed

5. Battle commands (MANOEUVREs and in battle commands)
------------------------------------------------------


ESSENTIAL COMMANDS
++++++++++++++++++

5.1.1. Focus fire at X

5.1.2. Shield X

5.1.4. Flank X
  

ESSENTIAL MANOEUVRES/FORMATIONS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5.2.1. Form firing line

5.2.2. Attack Wide

This mode of attack consists of movement in spread line thereby giving the enemy as many targets as possible. The idea has two benefits - 1st: The damage from enemy is spread across the tank group, 2nd: Friendly tanks have clear line of fire. The key word is Focusing fire. If our team focuses the fire correctly and enemy does not, the enemy is killed with minimum casualities. We are giving the enemy more targets to shoot while, at the same time, giving ourselves more oportunity to fire (because noone blocks the line of fire).

5.2.3 Attack Narrow

This mode of attack consists of movement in column while the tanks at front with the best armor take the initial hits by the enemy.
