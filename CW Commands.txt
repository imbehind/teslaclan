TACTICAL COMMANDS
=================

These commands are issued by squad leader PRESENT AT THE SITE. Movement commands should allways be issued together with engagement commands to ensure the right response from soldiers. The commands can be issued to the whole group (Push and open fire, Hold & Peek-a-boo) or to single tank (Retreat and Take cover - i.e. to keep tank on low health alive for next CW battle)

1. Tactical movement commands
-----------------------------
(describing the mode of movement)

1.1. Push

While pushing IT IS ALLOWED TO STOP for the right reasons. You can stop to aim-and-shoot. You can stop to avoid being hitted. It is allowed to stop if you are at low health and/or you think moving forward is not a very good idea (inform commander!). It is allways important NOT TO BLOCK your teammate's movement and/or line of fire while pushing unless told otherwise (narrow/cluster movement).

1.1. Push Strict

Same as Push, but DO NOT STOP for any reason other to being detracked. The idea to gain tactical advantage over the enemy.

1.3. Hold (position)

You are to hold your (general) position at any circumstances unless told otherwise. The engagement command should describe the details.  

1.4. Retreat

While retreating IT IS ALLOWED TO STOP for the right reasons. The general idea is TO SLOW DOWN THE ENEMY. These reasons include aim-and-shoot, reloading while in cover, if you estimate you are in good enough position to fight the enemy... 

1.5. Retreat Strict

Same as Retreat, but IT IS BEST NOT TO STOP. The general idea is to KEEP YOUR TANK ALIVE. Your tank is needed elswhere where it contribute better to overall victory and it is your duty to keep it alive as long as possible.



2. Tactical Engagement commands
-------------------------------
(describing the mode of enemy engagement)

2.1. Hold Fire

DO NOT FIRE at any cost! (i.e. issued during entrapment, or spotting/patrolling)

2.2. Open Fire

FIRE AT WILL! Engage allways the lowest health tank or marked tank!

2.3. Peek-a-boo (Default static position)

If the squad leader or commander do not issue engagement command, this is the default mode.

2.4. Attack-at-will

Attack as you wish. It is allowed to break formation and flank the enemy.

2.5. Take Cover (From fire)

Tanks given this order should find cover from enemy fire at all cost.

2.6. Hide (From view)

Tanks given this order should find cover from enemy view at all cost and stay hidden until further notice.




STRATEGIC COMMANDS
==================

These commands are issued by team commander. The idea for this commands is to convey general strategic idea from the commander to the squad leaders AND/OR to the soldiers, but without unnecessary details and micromanagement involved. Strategic commands are to ensure that the general expected behaviour of every individual soldier is clear to all, even without squad leader to enforce them. Strategic movement commands are not necessary issued in pairs with strategic engagement commands. The commands are to be issued to the group of tanks, but can be applied to individuals also.


3. Strategic commands
------------------------------

3.1. Move to X

While moving IT IS ALLOWED TO STOP for the right reasons. Similar to tactical push command - you advance to the designated postion and do not stop unless you have good reasons to do it.

3.2. Move to X Strict

Same as Move, but you DO NOT STOP for any reason other to being detracked. The idea is by using run to gain strategic advantage over the enemy. This command is similar to tactical push strict command.

3.2. Capture (and hold position) X

The goal for this command is to capture (or drive to) a specific position on a map and hold it AT ANY COST until told otherwise.

3.3. Engage X

The goal for this command is to engage designated enemy group of tanks and try to eliminate them, but NOT AT ANY COST (use your brain soldier!). The group should remain engaged with enemy until told otherwise.

3.4. Engage X Strict

The goal for this command is to kill designated enemy group of tanks AT ANY COST (Short of kamikaze attack). The group should remain engaged with enemy until told otherwise.

3.4. Fall back (to X)

Fall back represents fighting retreat used either for slowing down the enemy if overpowered or if luring enemy to a trap or similar. The idea is to go backward gradually while still engaged with the enemy. This command is similar to tactical retreat command.

3.5. Fall back to X Strict

Evacuate is a form of retreat with main idea of keeping as many tanks as possible alive for the continuation of the battle.  This command is similar to tactical retreat strict command.



4. Mode
-------

These command are the most general directions possible from the commander to his tanks. The idea is to allow the commander to delegate reposibility to a platoon which will allow him to concentrate his attention elswhere on the battlefield, while ensuring that the group of tanks which recieved the command will not screw up bigtime, even if no squad leader is present. In short, these commands represent general guidelines for tank movement while faced with the enemy. The commands are dynamic and soldiers should adapt depending on the situation.

4.1. Be Passive

Tells the platoon leader to be defensive and not risk anything. The platoon should hold the general position they were assigned, but fall back if the platoon leader deems this necessary (but should inform the commander when that happens). They should not push forward, even if the squad leader thinks it's possible.

4.2. Be Aggressive

Tells the platoon leader to be aggressive and push forward if he deems it possible.

Example: "Defend aggresive at F4" (think the pass behind snipe position on Mountain Pass) , "Advance normal towards enemy base" (Think uphill on El Halluf)
