TACTICAL COMMANDS
=================

These commands are issued by squad leader PRESENT AT THE SITE. Movement commands should always be issued together with engagement commands to ensure the right response from soldiers. The commands can be issued to the whole group (Push and open fire, Hold & Peek-a-boo) or to single tank (Retreat and Take cover - i.e. to keep tank on low health alive for next CW battle - currently our commander always have to explain to the eager noob why he should stay alive and fight another day :) - Hawker somehow pops into mind :D)


1. Tactical movement commands
-----------------------------

## In my opinion, commands should be one short word (yes, just like for dogs :)). "Strict + something" just doesn't cut it here. These commands must be clear when issued EVEN UNDER FIRE. Can you imagine Hawker yelling "Retreat strict! Retreat Strict!" :D? I cannot. It’s not practical. That's why I have changed back to older version despite our previous agreement. Do you agree with my explanation?

(describing the mode of movement)

1.1. Push

While pushing IT IS ALLOWED TO STOP for the right reasons. You can stop to aim-and-shoot. You can stop to avoid being hitted. It is allowed to stop if you are at low health and/or you think moving forward is not a very good idea (inform commander!). It is always important NOT TO BLOCK your teammate's movement and/or line of fire while pushing unless told otherwise (narrow/cluster movement).

1.2. Rush

Same as Push, but DO NOT STOP for any reason other to being detracked. The idea is usually exploit/gain some tactical (more tanks) or strategic (better position) advantage over the enemy.

1.3. Hold (position)

You are to hold your (general) position at any circumstances unless told otherwise. The engagement command should describe the details.  

1.4. Back

While going back IT IS ALLOWED TO STOP for the right reasons. The general idea is TO SLOW DOWN THE ENEMY. These reasons include aim-and-shoot, reloading while in cover or if you estimate you are in good enough position to fight the enemy... 

1.5. Run

Same as Back, but IT IS BEST NOT TO STOP. The priority is to KEEP YOUR TANK ALIVE. Your tank is needed elsewhere where it can better contribute to overall victory and it is your duty to keep it alive as long as possible.



2. Tactical Engagement commands
-------------------------------

(describing the mode of enemy engagement, often issued together with tactical movement commands)

2.1. Peek-a-boo (Default engagement mode)

If the squad leader or commander does not issue the engagement command, this is the default mode.

2.2. Open Fire

Open fire but DON'T BREAK FORMATION. Engage always the lowest health tank or marked tank if not ordered otherwise!

2.3. Attack-at-will

Attack as you wish. It is ALLOWED TO BREAK FORMATION and flank the enemy.

2.4. Take Cover (From fire)

Tanks given this order should find cover from enemy fire at all cost.

2.5. Hold Fire / Hide (From view) 

DO NOT FIRE at any cost! (i.e. issued during entrapment, long range engagement or spotting/patrolling). Tanks given this order should find cover from enemy view at all cost and stay hidden until further notice.

## I've joined these 2 commands. Hold fire has no meaning if already spotted by the enemy.



STRATEGIC COMMANDS
==================

## I've changed the concept into one in which strategic modes - Passive and Aggressive (OR IF UNSPOKEN, THEN DEFAUTS TO NORMAL) - change the behavior of our tanks and the way the strategic tasks are executed. Also, I've shorten the list to 5 commands, which is better. Everything seems intuitive to me now, what do you think?
## As you can see, I've eliminated "strict" completely. No need for it. Also, I think, from my experience in the army and navy (and also dog training :D) that the commands should consist of only one word, if possible (we already have strategic mode secondary command, so...)
## Also, one special command is Move - i.e. El Halluf move to their hill. This command has no modes (modifiers). We use it a lot so...

These commands are issued by the team commander. The idea behind these commands is to convey the general strategic plan from the commander to the squad leaders AND/OR to the soldiers, but without unnecessary details and micromanagement involved. Strategic commands are here to ensure that the general expected behavior of every individual soldier is clear to all, even without squad leader to enforce it. Strategic task commands are not necessary issued in pairs with strategic mode commands - In that case, the Normal strategic mode is presumed. The commands are to be issued to the group of tanks, but can be applied to individuals also.


3. Strategic mode commands
--------------------------

Strategic mode commands are regularly issued together with strategic tasks commands and they change the nature of task execution.

These commands are the most general directions possible from the commander to his tanks. The idea is to allow the commander to delegate responsibility to a platoon which will allow him to concentrate his attention elsewhere on the battlefield, while ensuring that the group of tanks which received the command will not screw up magnificently, even if no squad leader is present. In short, these commands represent general guidelines for tanks behaviour facing the enemy tanks. The commands are dynamic and soldiers should adapt depending on the situation. 

3.1. Passive

The main goal is to KEEP OUR TANKS SAFE. Platoon leader should PUSH FORWARD ONLY UPON PERMIT from the commander.

Tells the platoon leader to be defensive and not risk anything. The platoon should slowly advance or hold the general position they were assigned (depending on the task), but fall back if the platoon leader deems this necessary (but should inform the commander when that happens). They should not push forward if faced with the enemy, even if the squad leader thinks it's possible to owerpower the enemy tanks.

3.2. Aggressive

The main goal is to ELIMINATE THE ENEMY. Platoon leader should RETREAT ONLY UPON PERMIT from the commander.

Tells the platoon leader to be aggressive and try to eliminate the enemy even at high cost (everything short of kamikaze attack is fine). 

3.3. Normal

The main goal is to ADAPT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES. PUSH/KILL IF POSSIBLE, RETREAT IF NECESSARY. It is the default mode.

This mode does not need to be ordered by the commander. If strategic task is issued without specific mode, it defaults to Normal, and it falls upon platoon leader and/or tanks in the field to adapt to the situation.


4. Strategic task commands
--------------------------

## Additional Passive/Normal/Aggressive modes explained. Maybe not needed.

4.1. Move to X

## Ex Run

Unconditional strategic repositioning of the tanks. You DO NOT STOP for any reason other to being detracked. The idea using Move is to gain strategic POSITIONAL advantage over the enemy. No short term tactical gain (killing or damaging enemy tanks) is an excuse to disobey this command.

This command is special and it has no modes. 

4.2. Advance to(wards) X

## Ex move, joined together with advance from strategic modes

Advancing the tanks in the indicated direction or towards some designated position.

Passive - While advancing YOU MUST STOP if faced with the opposition.

Normal - While advancing IT IS ALLOWED TO STOP for the right reasons. Similar to tactical push command - you advance towards the designated position and do not stop unless you have good reasons to do it.

Aggressive - While advancing IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO STOP until the enemy is eliminated or the designated position is reached. Similar to tactical Rush command.

4.3. Capture (and hold position) X / Defend X

## incorporated Defend from strategic modes here

The goal for this command is to capture (or drive to) a specific position on a map and defend it until told otherwise. The command is executed successfully when all tanks are on the designated position and with no opposition present.

## The main difference to the Advance command is that the Advance command is DIRECTIONAL, and Capture/Defend command is POSITIONAL - That's why we need both. 

Passive - KEEP TANKS ALIVE, RETREAT IF WEAKER, DO NOT PUSH

Normal - ADAPT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES, DO NOT TAKE UNNECESSARY RISKS, DO NOT PUSH

Aggressive - KILL ALL ENEMY, DO NOT RETREAT, DO NOT PUSH

4.4. Engage X

Attacking the enemy group of tanks.

Passive - The goal for this command is to DISTRACT OR LURE enemy group of tanks, but safely in a way that the enemy cannot deal much damage to friendly tanks. The group should disengage and retreat automatically if the enemy counterattacks in force. 

Normal - The goal for this command is to ATTACK designated enemy group of tanks and try to eliminate them, but NOT AT ANY COST (use your brain soldier!). The group should remain engaged with enemy until told otherwise.

Aggressive - The goal for this command is to KILL designated enemy group of tanks AT ANY COST (Short of kamikaze attack). The group should remain engaged with enemy until told otherwise.

4.5. Retreat (to X)

Retreating in the indicated direction or towards some designated position.

Passive - a form of retreat with main idea of keeping alive as many tanks as possible for the continuation of the battle. The tank group should retreat to the designated (or the SAFEST) position in the QUICKEST AND THE MOST SAFE WAY possible. This command is similar to tactical retreat command.

Normal - "fighting retreat" manoeuvre used either for slowing down the enemy if overpowered or for luring the enemy into a trap or into a bad strategic position. If the enemy stops their advance, the tank group should still RETREAT TO THE DESIGNATED POSITION and await further orders.

Aggressive - fighting retreat used for slowing down the enemy if overpowered. The idea is to go backward gradually while still engaged with the enemy. If the enemy stops advance, the tank group should HOLD THE NEW POSITION and await further orders.



Example: "Defend aggressive at F4" (think the pass behind snipe position on Mountain Pass), "Advance (normal - not spoken) towards enemy base" (Think uphill on El Halluf), "Passive capture the city deep" on Lakeville



BATTLE COMMANDS
===============

Issued by the squad leader in the battle to the tanks in his immediate vicinity. These commands cannot be issued to the tanks without detailed knowledge of their situation so these are in principle not used by commander or squad leaders across the map.

5. Battle commands (MANOEUVREs and in battle commands)
------------------------------------------------------


ESSENTIAL COMMANDS
++++++++++++++++++

5.1.1. Focus fire at X

All tanks in group should focus fire on the designated tank and kill it ASAP.

5.1.2. Shield X

Designated or closest friendly tank(s) should shield the friendly tank on low health to avoid his further damage/death. You are supposed to take a hit to save your teammate.

5.1.4. Flank X

Designated or best situated tank(s) should move to the sides or if possible to the back of designated enemy tank(s) and try to kill.


ESSENTIAL MANOEUVRES/FORMATIONS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5.2.1. Group movement

This manoeuvre represents basic organized group movement. The aim is to achieve a coherent group movement, without tanks falling off from the group. The idea is to appear before the enemy all at once avoiding focused fire from the enemy. Depending of the formation (spread/line or column/cluster) the group should also be able to provide either the clear line of fire for all tanks (spread formation), or protection from front by most armoured tanks (or scapegoats :))

5.2.2. Form firing line

This formation is basic deffensive/offensive formation which in defensive mode provides primarily protection for tanks in the formation. (Remember macedonian phalanx). In offensive mode, since tanks do not block each other, this formation provides protection while reloading and clear shot in peek-a-boo kind of attack on the exposed/unordered enemy.

5.2.3. Attack Wide

This mode of attack consists of movement in spread line thereby giving the enemy as many targets as possible. The idea has two benefits - 1st: The damage from enemy is spread across the tank group, 2nd: Friendly tanks have clear line of fire. The key word is Focusing fire. If our team focuses the fire correctly and enemy does not, the enemy is killed with minimum causalities on our side. We are giving the enemy more targets to shoot while, at the same time, giving ourselves more opportunity to fire (because no one blocks the line of fire).

5.2.4 Attack Narrow

This mode of attack consists of movement in column while the tanks at front, with the best armor, take the initial hits by the enemy.

PLAYER STATUS MESSAGES
======================

## this chapter is very important because it provides the commander (teammates) with audio feedback on progres executing his orders or the situation on the battlefield.

Status messages are spoken by soldiers to inform teammates/commanders


7.1. Basic communication

7.1.1. Affirmation - Roger, Understood, Affirmative, Jawohl...

7.1.2. Negation - Negative... 

7.1.3. Cannot execute - Unable...

## please give more suggestions for keywords.


7.2. General status - upon request of a commander

7.2.1. Overpowered / Losing / Dead

7.2.2. Dominant / Winning / Cleared 

7.2.3. Neutral / Fighting / In battle


7.3. Individual tank status - upon request of squad leader or by yourself

7.3.1. Low health / Dead soon

7.3.2. Fucked up (modules damaged) / In flames / Detracked

7.3.3. Reloading (in x seconds)

7.3.4. Spotted


7.4. Informative messages - by yourself

7.4.1. X (Enemy) detracked

7.4.2. X (Enemy/Arty) spotted

7.4.3. Firing at X (in Y seconds)

7.4.4. Shielding X


7.5. Requests - by yourself

7.5.1. X, Cover me / Shield me

7.5.2. X, Help (with Y) - general help request - requires desription, i.e. "I'm stuck on map, please push"

## 7.5.3. X, I'll cover you - moved to 7.4.4., but for shielding - I think it is important to announce shielding (if not asked for it), because the shielded tank could by accident shoot in tank doing the shield. For covering, if asked, "Affirmative" is enough, if not asked, not important.
